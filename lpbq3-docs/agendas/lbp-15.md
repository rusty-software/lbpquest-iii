**Thursday, June 19th:**  
  
9am - Pre-gaming for LBP grocery shopping begins at Chase's house in Cedar Park, The Gateway to LBP. Beer and Cheetos will be served.  
  
10:30am - Tony obtains possibly the most delicious brisket known to man.  
  
11am - Tony realizes that he should probably leave the last little bit for the rest of us, and that he has made a terrible mistake for the LBPweigh-in.  
  
11:45 - LBP grocery shopping begins at the Cedar Park HEB, which is the closest grocery store to the PLT (17817 Kingfisher Ridge Dr, Lago Vista, TX 78645). I may have to abstain from this activity, as that is my primary food center, and I don't want to forever shame myself with the locals. Tony is not looking so good.  
  
12pm - Hopeful check-in time. Sure, sure, they always say like 4pm, but we will not be denied the PLT, for she is the incubator of our weekend's seed. Be sure to pick up your name tag and LBP XV Custom Koozie at the check-in desk, and be prepared to submit yourself for biometric analysis (weight, body fat %, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, sperm count). Sam will be available for modeling if Phil has any problems producing samples.  
  
2pm - Actual check-in time, because shopping. Tony is now fully involved in the meat sweats from inhaling the better part of a brisket. Po and Sam contemplate anesthetizing and opening up Tony to remove the brisket. For The Greater Good. Tony agrees, if only to get his biometrics optimized at check-in.  
  
3pm - Someone pulls the party lever and we all end up in the pool. Everyone forgets to bring a cooler full of beer to poolside. Balls.  
  
5pm - Dr. Brewer gives a symposium on the history of privilege in the animal kingdom, using the common muskrat and the now-extinct North American ground sloth as his thesis.  
  
7pm - Game 6 of the NBA shooty-hoop finals, served up with delicious pre-digested Franklin brisket. Tony, partially recovered from the meat sweats and not-at-all recovered from the impromptu surgery, cheers like a little girl as the Pacers lay into the Spurs and tears several sutures. Bill pitches the first of his new business ideas to Keith and Phil, both of whom appear very intrigued.  
  
9pm - All of the porn that was brought to the house has been inspected for quality assurance, and it is deemed to be good.  
  
10pm - Todd, full of meat and beer, gives the grandest, most amazing sermon of all time and converts everyone at LBP to his specific version of Christianity, which is indeed the correct one. All of the porn is summarily thrown into the fire because it is scandalous and sinful.  
  
**Friday, June 20:**  
  
8am - Consciousness returns, and with it great shame. Why do we make such poor life choices?  
  
9am - Tony, the only one of us to not drink heavily the night before due to doctors orders, is well enough to cook breakfast.  
  
10am - Phil attempts to pull out his work laptop, and it is immediately seized and impounded, along with his cell phone and pager. Yes, Phil still has a pager.  
  
11am - Rusty begins reading War and Peace. Garner starts making guacamole.  
  
12pm - The annual LBP Golf Tournament begins.  
  
12:15pm - Everyone questions why we started the golf tournament this late in the day, it's fucking hot!  
  
2pm - Everyone not playing golf is enjoying the pool and beer, wondering why idiots would play golf in this heat.  
  
3pm - The tournament finally makes the turn, and Keith's magical putting is on full display. How does he always manage to only putt in the tournament?  
  
4pm - Rusty finishes reading War and Peace, even while playing golf. Garner is still making guacamole.  
  
6pm - Keith sinks a 50 foot putt to win the golf tournament for himself and Sam. Sam looks on in disbelief as his hard work on every other shot during the round is ignored and only Keith's magical putting is revered.  
  
7pm - Dr. Brewer gives a keynote speech on the failings of upwardly mobile white men to improve education for economically depressed, non-white men, thus perpetuating the racial imbalance of wealth in America. Everyone is totally surprised by his findings. During this time he also makes delicious hamburgers, which everyone enjoys.  
  
9pm - Dr. Brewer hits someone.  
  
11pm - Garner is still making guacamole.  
  
**Saturday, June 21:**  
  
8am - Consciousness returns, and with it great shame. Why do we make such poor life choices?  
  
9am - Rusty and Tony serenade the PLT with a rousing rendition of "Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah" while making breakfast. Dan records the unannounced concert and plans to make a hit single out of it with Todd later that night with their guitars.  
  
10am - Everyone mills about uncomfortably. Isn't there something we're supposed to do today? Something important? Something that we always do?  
  
11am - Sudden panic sets in as everyone realizes that, not only is there no boat to board, but Tony forgot to get the deli-sliced turkey meat for sandwiches. Phil goes full-red and checks everyone into a window frame.  
  
12pm - Nick and Garner win their 30th game of spades in a row. No one is surprised. Garner is still making guacamole.  
  
2pm - Absent a boat, everyone jumps into the pool and splashes around in a frolicky but still manly way. Willie doesn't quite know what to make of it, but he joins in anyway.  
  
3pm - The Sega Genesis NHL 95 playoffs are winding down, and the finals are between Damon (playing the Buffalo Sabres) and Keith (Detroit Red Wings). In a deliriously action-packed game 7, Damon's Sabres take out Doug Brown in the first period and go on to a 4-3 overtime win.  
  
5pm - The whiskey comes out, and CB emerges from the shadows.  
  
6pm - Game 7 of the NBA shooty-hoops finals comes on, and CB, full of glorious whiskey and power, cheers on the Spurs to yet another NBA title. He is now fully prepared for the LBP Poker Tournament. Delicious fajitas made with HEB fajita chicken breasts are served. Bill is still reeling off business ideas.  
  
9pm - The first hand of the LBP Poker Tournament is dealt. Todd and Dan are perfecting their sheet music for "Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah", throwing in an occasional extra dirty G7 in there for good measure.  
  
9:01pm - Keith goes out on an all-in with K-J spades. No, he doesn't have a favorite hand or anything.  
  
9:20pm - The price of poker goes up, but not nearly enough. Success! Garner has finished the guacamole! Dan and Todd celebrate the occasion with the theme song from "Punky Brewster"  
  
11:20pm - Five players are still in, but Rusty has a dominant chip stack. CB is softly snoring at one end of the table, preparing to make his run.  
  
12:45am - Three players, and CB is showing his cards to everyone who will look.  
  
1am - CB, with the chip lead, goes pre-flop all-in against both Phil and Nick showing 3-7 off. Both players eagerly call, having much better paint hands. Flop comes out 4-5-6 rainbow, and CB wins the LBP Poker Tournament. Phil cannot believe his poor luck!  
  
**Sunday, June 22:**  
  
8am - Consciousness returns, and with it great shame. Why do we make such poor life choices?  
  
9am - PSDs are consumed in mass quantities. Also, cinnamon rolls and cereals. Anything and everything breakfast-related is put on display for consumption.  
  
10am - The equitable distribution of leftover LBP groceries begins. Two spare bags of Cheetos, half a case of Coors Light, and the uncooked package of Earls are fought for vigorously. Tony quietly makes off with two 12 packs of Coke Zero, but everyone is pretty okay with that.  
  
11am - Todd provides a powerful benediction, challenging us all to work harder for his particular version of God. The door is closed, the lock is set, and the key is put away for another year. We all make our way home, and we begin to dream again of the sunny days of LBP.
