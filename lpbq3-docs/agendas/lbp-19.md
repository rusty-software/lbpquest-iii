Submitted for your approval, the agenda for our trip to the Casa Cantera in Wimberley, TX.  
**  
Thursday, July 19th, 2018**  
  
8:00am - The trek to LBP XIX has begun! 14 different Google Maps searches for Casa Cantera go mysteriously unresolved, so everyone has to just search for Wimberley and then follow the scent of meat to the house.  
  
9:00am - Burdened with the task of provisioning LBP now that Tony is an AI, Chase picks up two Franklin briskets and some sauce to pour out for LBPers that can't make the trip.  
  
10:00am - Chase, Garner and Rusty all go grocery shopping at different locations with the same spreadsheet that has been used for 18 years. Triple the food for LBP!  
  
12:00pm - Phil, who with the help of Sam has spent the past year recovering from being a lobster, arrives at Casa Cantera and awaits the door code from whoever rented this place. Somebody rented it, right?  
  
12:30pm - Todd and Curtis arrive and turn the doorknob. It opens. When will Phil learn?  
  
1:00pm - Most of the rest of the attendees arrive, including the unpacking of three loads of groceries, and Damon and Chuck are carrying a well-oiled and burnished keg of Celis Grand Cru. It sparkles!  
  
1:15pm - Todd, wanting to mark the occassion, decides to consecrate Casa Cantera. After a powerful invocation and a liberal use of holy water, a bolt of lightning strikes the house and cleaves the dining room table. A slow moan emanates from behind the broken table, something about tax liability and VR futures. Tony, naked as a jaybird, emerges from the smoke. He is whole and hale! Not even the incision from his brisketectomy can be found. What the what?  
  
1:30pm - After some deliberation and light exorcism rituals from Todd, the group decides to at least hand Tony some clothes. Sam takes to trying to examine Tony, but Tony is consumed with hunger and has been plowing through Cheetos like mad. Chase hides the briskets.  
  
3:00pm - Sam finishes his examination and finds Tony to be in perfect health. So perfect, in fact, that he wants to extract some blood and tissue to do a little research on the side. Tony is still eating, so people start to become concerned about whether he might be a zombie.  
  
4:00pm - Tai pulls out a Kodak camera and starts taking pictures of everyone. He puts all of the pictures up on the fireplace mantle below the TV, which for once actually has correct aspect ratio. Yay! No one bothers to ask where the camera came from, or how it is okay to take pictures at LBP, which it is NOT.  
  
5:00pm - Tony has consumed 25% of the food that was procured by The Three Wise Foodmen. He appears sated for the moment, so the briskets are put in their water bath. Just for good measure, Todd sprinkles a little holy water into the pan. Can't hurt, right?  
  
7:00pm - Two Franklin briskets have been consumed, and they are by far the best briskets ever made. Even Tony, in his food coma, can't help but have two servings.  
  
9:00pm - Cards emerge and cash poker is started. Phil has some trouble betting his chips a couple of times which perplexes him, but otherwise a normal night of poker, with Phil losing hand after hand due to bad beats.  
  
11:00pm - Damon and Chuck both succumb to the insane amounts of Grand Cru that they have imbibed. Can they maintain the pace?  
  
**Friday, July 20th, 2018**  
  
8:00am - Everyone wakes up at practically the same moment, with no hangovers or ill effects from eating a disturbing amount of meat the night before. This is probably fine. Chuck and Damon set into the Cru again.  
  
9:00am - Breakfast is had, and questions are raised about the LBP Golf Tournament. For once, everyone is awake and well enough to play. Chase didn't bother to book tee times because it is going to be 120 degrees outside and no one ever plays. UGH!  
  
10:00am - Keith finally arrives. He mentions that he stopped by the golf course on the way in and couldn't find us, so just tapped-in on 18 from 400 yards out to be sure. Keith wins the LBP Golf Tournament AGAIN!  
  
10:01am - Tony walks out of his bedroom and Keith immediately loses his shit. He clutches frantically at the USB key chain around his neck, and calls Willie into the Casita to determine next steps.  
  
11:00am - Nick peers quizically at the furniture in the house, and immediately starts referencing his global databases.  
  
12:00pm - Phil has been staring at the pictures on the mantle for a while now, he seems a little worried.  
  
1:00pm - Keith emerges from the Casita with Willie in tow, and thrusts several hastily written documents at Tony. Tony, still not fully himself, mumbles about Double Irish arrangments and accumulated depreciation of server farms. Keith shrieks like a girl and tries to attack Tony, but is held back by Joey and Curtis. Phil tries to get involved but seems to whiff on every tackle.  
  
1:15pm - Tai turns on Rounders to try to calm everyone down. Rusty cheers at the part where Mike wins. Curtis seems not to notice. He might be sleeping.  
  
3:00pm - Unmarked by anyone, Tony has consumed another sizeable amount of LBP groceries. But he's becoming more talkative, so that's a good thing, right? Zombies don't talk, do they?  
  
4:00pm - Curtis demands that everyone stop looking at his cards! This while he is making burgers and steaks for dinner. Everyone is confused. He hasn't even been drinking...  
  
5:00pm - Everyone is now starting to take note of the fact that Phil isn't quite all there. Literally. He has a bit of a translucent sheen and from time to time actually becomes transparent. This is also reflected in the Kodak photo on the mantle.  
  
6:00pm - Dinner is finished, and the 10th game of Mafia has been completed as well, with Phil being the Doctor every time, and also being killed first every time.  
  
7:00pm - Judging by Phil's ethereal appearance and Keith's apparent bloodlust, it is decided to have the LBP Poker Tournament on Friday night so that everyone is still around/alive for it. Sam is completely astonished and has to scramble to rearrange his Spotify playlist to compensate for the time change.  
  
8:00pm - Half of the group has already gone out in the poker tournament, and CB has already appeared, despite no Jack Daniels to be found in the house. Phil remains spreadfast though, and although he occasionally needs someone to move his chips for him, he can still see his cards by putting his head through the bottom of the table.  
  
9:00pm - On a hunch, Chuck runs to the liquor store to buy some Jameson for CB. As CB continues to imbibe, he actually becomes more Curtis-like. Strange indeed. Nick submits for review a report about the provenance of the furniture in the house, and how it is not actually rustic Texan but rather ancient Gaelic. But whatever, right? Todd furrows his brow and retreats to his quiet place, jalapeno poppers in hand.  
  
11:00pm - Keith is found honing his USB key into a makeshift shiv. It is subsequently taken from him and put in an undisclosed location. He begins to whimper. Keith remains in the tournament for two more hands, then goes out on a K-J suited all-in bet that is called and shat on by Sam's pair of aces. He wanders off in search of his key.  
  
12:00am - Curtis, inebriated but actually talking sense about educational policy paradigms in Medieval Europe, goes out of the LBP Poker Tournament, leaving only Sam, Tai and Garner, who has been dicing tomatoes and kicking ass for hours on end.  
  
**Saturday, July 21st, 2018**  
  
1:00am - Sam dominates Tai in head-to-head poker and does a victory lap around the Casa. He has won The Chief! Upon claiming the trophy, Sam instantly disappears into a portal of light and sound!  
  
3:00am - Keith is found with a Gollum-like demeanor standing over Tony's sleeping body. "I must have the Precious!" he cries, and is immediately subdued with chloroform-coated Nutter Butters.  
  
8:00am - Everyone wakes up at practically the same moment, with no hangovers or ill effects from eating a disturbing amount of meat the night before. This is probably fine. Chuck and Damon set into the Cru again.  
  
9:00am - Phil is having trouble finishing his breakfast. He puts it in his mouth and it ends up on the floor. Poor Phil!  
  
10:00am - A series of texts is received on Phil's phone. It's Sam! He's being teleported back and forth through time to various Dave Matthews and Coldplay concerts and having a blast!  
  
11:00am - Todd comes out of his nook to report that the Casa Cantera was actually built on what appears to be a druidic leyline, and the manifestations of various religious symbols, Gaelic furnishings and whatnot have created a font of power, triggered by his consecration. He thinks he can close it, but there might be...consequences.  
  
12:00pm - Phil cries out in anguish as he completely disapparates. The last thing heard from him is, "Just what Kingswood needs! Why me?"  
  
12:15pm - The phone rings. It's Phil! He's home safe and sound, but says he's unable to go south of his house. He'll just have to eat Cheetos at his place. Phil's sobbing is audible throughout the Casa Cantera.  
  
1:00pm - Damon and Chuck, who have literally been drinking Grand Cru from dawn until they pass out because they're just not getting hangovers, decide that maybe the house needs an offering. They set about filling the walls with Grand Cru to get the house drunk.  
  
3:00pm - Where's the boat? Is there even water in Wimberley? Given the heat wave, it's probably just for the best to stay inside and play board games.  
  
5:00pm - Garner finishes making three times the normal amount of guacamole, and just in time! Tony hungers yet again, and the rest of the group has to fight him off to get a few chips of guac each. Total amount of groceries consumed: Tony 70%, everyone else 10%. There is concern that there won't be enough food for the rest of LBP.  
  
6:00pm - Success! Even though Po isn't at LBP this year, he has delivered a supplementary crate of ribeyes, fajitas, and various sausages, along with more jalapenos and bacon. Right on, Po!  
  
8:00pm - Possibly the largest dinner ever made for LBP is set forth. Tony is more talkative than ever, and may be almost normal again.  
  
10:00pm - Todd, ready to perform the ceremony to close the leyline font, first must ingest at least 20 jalapeno poppers to get into the spirit. During the ritual, he belches fire and starts to speak woo in old Gaelic. The walls of the house, filled with Grand Cru, explode outward and bathe everyone in beer. Sam reappears with the Chief in hand, clearly distraught both that he is not at a concert and is covered in wall beer. Keith's USB key shatters into a million pieces, destroying forever the Tony AI, and completely restoring Tony to his original self. 250 miles away, a deafening scream can be heard as Phil's entire reason for being denied LBP is removed, but he's still in Dallas! Suck!  
  
12:00am - Joey, who has been fairly silent this entire time, makes a passionate speech about the dangers of meddling in arcane power and how it's much safer to just put your money in a hedge fund and retire early. Everyone loves this idea, and LBP Ventures, LLP is created.  
  
**Sunday, July 22nd, 2018**  
  
8:00am - Everyone is hung over like you wouldn't believe, and the bathrooms are stopped up with post-processed meat. A hastily-arranged breakfast of PSDs and Gatorade is consumed in quiet contemplation by the group.  
  
9:00am - Keith, apparently back to his normal self, has Willie draw up the appropriate documents to anull his custodianship of Tony. Tony and Keith embrace, maybe a little too tightly on Keith's part, and Tony owns himself again. He doesn't have any recollection of his time as an AI, which is probably for the best.  
  
10:00am - Todd, wary of the power of this place, decides not to do anything religious to mark the departure from LBP. Probably for the best as well. Garner is finally awoken and sent on his way.  
  
11:00am - Tony and Chase finish putting away the last of the trash and locking up the Casa Cantera. Chase leaves a note in the vistor's book to not perform rituals in the house, and Willie pens a sternly-worded letter to the owners about proper signage and liability waivers.  
  
12:00pm - Will we ever return? Only time will tell.
