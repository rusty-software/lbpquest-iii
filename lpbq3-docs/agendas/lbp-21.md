**Wednesday, August 4th 2021**  
  
8:00am - LBP is upon us! Maps are unfurled and reconnoitering equipment is provisioned to find Whitetail Ranch. Google Maps is of no use. It's probably fine.  
  
8:15am - Phil is found in his study, watching some obscure Netflix original series rather than finally getting around to watching Endgame. Brandi shoos him out of the house as she should, and confiscates his computer and pager.  
  
10:00am - Grocery Team Skaggs Alpha Beta arrives and begins procuring Cheetos and sliced deli meat. Tony, feeling swell as can be, decides that we probably don't need twice the normal amount of groceries. I mean, we're not at Casa Cantera, what could possibly happen? Garner still manages to sneak double the ingredients for guacamole into the final tally.  
  
12:00pm - Phil lingers at the threshold of the property. Isn't there supposed to be a gate or something? A blackbuck meanders along in the field, grazing peacefully. Phil sighs wistfully, this is just the vacation he needed. Peace and the outdoors! No sprint UATs! A full four days of LBP, the pool, and Silver Bullets.  
  
12:30pm - Keith blows past Phil and tears around the corner to Whitetail Ranch, flying off down the drive. Phil hears Kasabian's "Test Transmission" blaring as Keith careens toward the house, and could swear that he saw Tai and Willie in the back of the car. They appear to be wearing some kind of protective suit. Oh well.  
  
1:00pm - Tony, Chase, and Garner arrive with groceries, and find Phil just wandering around the front of the drive trying to pet random wild animals. He tells them about Keith, and they all proceed toward the house, wherever that might be.  
  
2:00pm - After getting lost five different times, the house is finally located. It appears to be sealed off like the house in E.T..Â  A long, tall tube leads to a decontamination room, which then leads to a clean room that houses multiple suits which look exactly like what Tai and Willie were wearing. Keith stands outside the tube with Willie beside him, sitting at a desk with a stack of papers in front of him and a filing cabinet within arms reach.  
  
2:15pm - Keith finishes walking through the terms and conditions of staying at the Ranch, including a valid test result and a small blood draw. Everyone signs without reading the fine print. Because of course they do. Willie files things away and all is well. A celebratory brisket is put on to bathe.  
  
4:00pm - Sam and Joey show up just in time for the brisket cutting, Sam muttering something about the dangers of taking people's blood. The meat is succulent and delicious as always. Another brisket is put on to warm. Tai gets to work setting up the media room for a weekend-long run of Fast & Furious movies, now that we have all watched everything Marvel-related.  
  
5:00pm - Todd, Dan and Curtis pull up in an early 90s Honda Accord. They all reek of automotive fluids, apparently the car broke down twice on the ranch while trying to find the house, but Dan has a trunk full of spare parts, so no big deal.  
  
6:00pm - Rusty arrives as the second brisket emerges and is equally enjoyed. Nothing but scraps of lean meat remain. Oh well! To the early stork goes the worm.  
  
7:00pm - LBP D&D commences just as Bill arrives. He is extremely upset about the brisket being gone, and demands satisfaction. A charcuterie board is laid out before him and he is mollified for the time being.  
  
9:00pm - DK and Po arrive at the ranch, but are stopped at the tube. DK, in his haste and AFC lust, forgot to get a COVID test and instead raided a Wal-Mart pregnancy test aisle in an attempt to fake his way into LBP. Tests are tests, right? Fortunately, Keith has an entire trunkload of testing kits on hand and, after a brief delay, both are certified fresh and allowed inside. Willie files away the test results, peering quizzically at the pee stick before tossing it in the folder.  
  
11:00pm - After a marathon double session of LBP D&D, in which our heroes valiantly battle and defeat the dastardly Zotzilaha(sp?), it's time to break out the cash and chips and play some poker. Phil, completely content with life, lets the bad beats wash over and past him. After all, he got Zotzilaha's key, and he's on vacation for four whole days!  
  
**Thursday, August 5th 2021**  
  
8:00am - Each attendee is individually awoken by Keith, who insists that everyone be nose-swabbed for COVID this morning. He has a testing company arriving within the hour to process tests, and needs things in order. DK awakens and immediately runs to the bathroom to vomit.  
  
9:00am - Breakfast is served. Bill grumbles over his plate of protein about not getting any brisket, and peers out the window with narrowed eyes. DK just blanches at breakfast and instead goes for black (decaf) coffee. Dan, Todd and Tony pull out guitars and sing a song of the fertile land.  
  
10:00am - DK, sufficiently recovered from his morning bout, opens the breakout sessions with a spirited symposium on covered calls and hatching your nest egg. Joey takes notes in the back. Po cannot help but notice that DK is positively glowing.  
  
11:00am - Guacamole breakout session begins with Garner offering best practices on cutting techniques and ingredient granularity. This breakout session is set up as a come-and-go workshop over the next three days.  
  
12:00pm - Everyone in the pool! Delicious ciders and cold beers are had by everyone, and the HomePod is rocking hard to DJ Magic Mike. Out in the pasture several varieties of deer and some zebras can be seen swaying to the bass. Bill hatches a plan.  
  
3:00pm - Upon exiting the pool, DK appears to have a noticeable distension of his stomach, which is worrisome because he hasn't even been drinking. Sam does some preliminary checks and requests that Keith hand over DK's blood sample. Keith complies and hands over DK's folder, though grudgingly.  
  
4:00pm - The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is on, and with it Chase's Reggaeton breakout session begins. Almost everyone focuses on the movie, and rightly so. Chase speaks eloquently throughout the movie, with exculpatory data, about how all Reggaeton music uses exactly the same dembow riddim backbeat, is autotuned to all hell, and all music videos are an example of how Reggaeton artists dress poorly for cocktail hours compared to the women in the videos. Basically Nickelback, but with nicer cars. Willie becomes enraged and blares Despacito in response. Chase rests his case.  
  
5:00pm - NFL preseason game between the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers. Snacks and beers are enjoyed all around. Phil sighs contentedly at the unbelievable calm he feels while he's at LBP. But where is Bill?  
  
6:00pm - Dan heads out to the car to check the battery and oil, but finds it several hundred feet from where he left it, alongside a tractor. Odd.  
  
8:00pm - Delicious steaks are served, courtesy of Dr. Brewer and the suitcase of Dr. Lam. Bill bounds out of his room wearing a ghillie suit, devours his steak with his bare hands, then slathers the juices all over his suit. "Have to be stealthy," he mumbles, as he retreats down the hallway.  
  
9:00pm - Olympic Women's Soccer gold medal game, where the USWNT takes the pitch against the vaunted Swedish side, as well as the Women's Beach Volleyball gold medal game. An unholy amount of hotness is on display, and Alex Morgan gives the camera a knowing lip-bite to make all the boys swoon. A single overtime is all it takes for the US women to defeat their nemesis. The US women's volleyball team wins in a thriller.  
  
11:30pm - Cash game, and this time Phil starts winning big, mostly because Bill is not around to bully him. What an amazing vacation! Tony loses a good bit of money and decides to start a jam session with the Disco Toads by twanging a few notes of Punky Brewster. Sam, looking befuddled, emerges from his makeshift lab to announce that DK is pregnant! Everyone celebrates by watching the fourth film of the F&F series, Fast & Furious. Don't worry, the names get more intuitive later on.  
  
**Friday, August 6th 2021**  
  
8:00am - Each attendee is individually awoken by Keith, who insists that everyone be nose-swabbed for COVID this morning. He has a testing company arriving within the hour to process tests, and needs things in order. DK, his belly showing noticeably, awakens and immediately runs to the bathroom to vomit.  
  
9:00am - Breakfast is served, thanks to Todd and the wonder of coffee. No Bill to be found. People are getting worried about him. His room is filled with hand-sharpened wood spears, and a Bowie knife sits next to a framed picture of brisket.  
  
10:00am - Soccer rules breakout session. DK, who looks like he's hiding a soccer ball under his shirt, along with Willie discuss the complexities of league scoring formats and enlist Garner to compute the possibility of getting a tie in every game and still winning a league championship. Garner finds that possibility to be approximately 3,720 to one.  
  
11:00am - Breakout session on creating your own hedge fund for shits and giggles. Joey provides in-depth information on how to build a hedge fund from the ground up using only household items as collateral. The  
  
12:00pm - A TV is moved outside to watch Fast Five from the pool. Sam spends the time giving DK labor breathing lessons. The local fauna can be seen breathing at the same cadence.  
  
3:00pm - Out of the pool, time for more breakouts! Tony entrances the group with a Billy Mays-esque infomercial on the myriad uses for coconut oil. He slathers a load of white stuff on DK's bump to show how it reduces stretch marks! DK instantly buys a five gallon tub with a monthly subscription plan through Amazon.  
  
4:00pm - Keith finds a spare putter in the garage and taps a ball into a makeshift hole, winning the LBP Golf Tournament that never actually occurred. Dangit Keith!  
  
5:00pm - Dan stalks outside to find his car, which has again moved. This time it is found around the back of the cabin with the tractor, and to Dan's dismay half of the spare parts in his trunk have been used to rebuild the tractor's engine. The vehicles are far too close together for comfort, but when Dan approaches the tractor roars to life and revs angrily at him.  
  
6:00pm - Garner's guacshop is still rolling hard but in control. He's on to maximizing avocado yield and the art of the tomato. DK stealthily snatches an avocado and makes a salad.  
  
7:00pm - Drs. Crowley and Lam front a breakout session on spontaneous fertilization of male hosts in the animal kingdom. It's a short session, for obvious reasons. Fast and Furious 6 is put on to pass the time. Phil is really getting into this series, this is cinema!  
  
8:00pm - An anguished cry emanates from out in the field, an ungodly sound that no one should ever hear. Death has come to LBP! DK shudders involuntarily and retreats to his room, where he is clearly nesting.  
  
9:00pm - The LBP Poker Tournament begins, with several people missing from the field. Chase dreams of the possibility of finally bringing home The Chief, but Phil, who is clearly at peace with the world and himself, seems destined to win the game.  
  
11:00pm - Bill, in full camo and face paint, comes into the house holding a massive piece of flesh, eyes glazed and teeth bared. Outside, the carcass of a zebra can be seen hanging off the back of an ATV golf cart, with an obvious opening in its chest where a cow's brisket would come from. He sets about cleaning the zebrisket and preparing it for smoking.  
  
11:59pm - The LBPPT is in full swing, and Phil has a hand to make a serious move. This is easily the greatest weekend of his life. Nothing could possibly go wrong.  
  
12:00am - Phil's phone rings. His face becomes dour as he hangs up, sighs, and mucks his monster hand. Corporate has launched a stealth sprint and he has to go manage their screwups, NOW. A few moments later, bags hastily packed, he says his goodbyes and leaves the greatest weekend of his life behind. In the following hours the Chief is won, probably by Chase, but we'll never remember that. We'll only remember that Phil had to leave THE GREATEST WEEKEND OF HIS LIFE BEHIND.  
  
**Saturday, August 7th 2021**  
  
8:00am - Each attendee is individually awoken by Keith, who insists that everyone be nose-swabbed for COVID this morning. He has a testing company arriving within the hour to process tests, and needs things in order. DK looks like he's about to pop!  
  
9:00am - Pancake breakfast with Todd, including a breakout session on the intersection of faith and soccer. Bill has had the zebrisket in the smoker for several hours and sits patiently nearby, reading tips from /r/exoticsmoking. The rest of the zebra carcass was buried with respect in the early morning, and Pastor Todd has given it a proper eulogy for its sacrifice. Curtis attempts to help Bill with the smoking, but a near-feral Bill turns him away with a gnashing of teeth.  
  
10:00am - Furious Seven is an out-of-control thrill ride of a movie that Phil will probably never see because he left LBP. Willie has spent the better part of two days formulating his response to Chase's Reggaeton breakout session, and comes out swinging, stating that dembow riddim is the rhythm of our lives, and that without it life in the Caribbean would be sad and empty. Everyone agrees that it is a necessary evil and jumps into the pool to celebrate, with Bad Bunny and Karol G blaring. The animals in the fields seem to be patiently waiting for something.  
  
2:00pm - DK cries out in pain, labor has begun! Drs. Lam and Crowley set about figuring out how to deliver a baby with no lady parts to work with.  
  
4:00pm - Garner has finished his three day workshop on guacamole, and the results are AMAZING. Easily the best guac Garner has ever made, though it could still use a little more salt. DK eats three servings while HEE-HEE-HOOing.  
  
5:00pm - Next up in the F&F franchise is Fate of the Furious, a slapstick rom-com that proves that nothing is stronger than family. DK's contractions are getting super strong. It's almost time!  
  
6:00pm - Bill pulls the zebrisket from the smoker and sets it to rest. At the same time, but clearly unconnected to the event, DK is carefully opened up by the resident doctors, with Willie and Tai ready as doulas. Out springs a baby zebra! They attempt to wrangle the zebra down, but he escapes out an open door and flees for the safety of the wilds, where the assembled animals take him in and care for him. DK passes out and is stitched up.  
  
7:00pm - Bill carves up the zebrisket with determination. He stabs a forkful of moist and foists it into his mouth, and is immediately cured of his brisket lust. He looks at the remaining meat, realizing what he has done, and leaves it alone. Everyone else feasts on delicious fajitas that are completely guilt-free!  
  
8:00pm - Olympic men's soccer finals, Brazil vs Spain. Spain goes out hard against the Brazilians, taking a 3-0 lead at the midpoint, but Brazil comes storming back to win 5-3. Everyone cheers, but not too loud. Brazil was destined to win.  
  
10:00pm - DK, sufficiently recovered from his zebrectomy, yearns to see his zebraby again, to hold him close and love him. Someday, perhaps. Until then, Modelo, Reggaeton, and the stock market will have to keep him happy.  
  
**Sunday, August 8th 2021**  
  
8:00am - Each attendee is individually awoken by Keith, who insists that everyone be nose-swabbed for COVID this morning. He has a testing company arriving within the hour to process tests, and needs things in order. The group confronts Keith about his tests, and what the results are. Keith, flustered, grabs Willie and Tai and makes off with all of the tests and blood samples!  
  
9:00am - The standard Sunday PSD and orange juice breakfast is laid out. Dan looks for his car and sees it off in the distance with the tractor, apparently making a new life here on this land. Dan shrugs and picks the rubber fish up off the ground where the car had once been.  
  
10:00am - Todd, closing out LBP with his traditional sermon, speaks powerfully about the balance of the natural world, and how we should all learn and grow with the land, not just take from it. Meanwhile, the cleanup of LBP includes 12 bags of trash, as well as a split of the groceries that were bought but never eaten. Maybe someday we'll get it right.  
  
11:00am - Everyone heads their separate ways. Tony gives Dan, Todd, and Curtis a ride home. LBP XXI ends, and the hype for LBP XXII (The International) begins.
