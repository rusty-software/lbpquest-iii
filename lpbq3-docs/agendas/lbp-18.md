  
**Thursday, August (August!) 17, 2017:**  
  
8:00am - Phil arrives at the house and begins the long wait for the door code. He decides to dip in the pool, which at this time is a relatively harmless 95 degrees.  
  
10:00am - Since the outdoor breezeway is a thing, Todd and Curtis arrive and begin the earnest work of readying over 300 jalapeno poppers for the weekend.  
  
12:00pm - Success! The door to LBP magically opens, and inside we find Tony already basking in virtual reality. He has been in the house for the entire week immersed in a world filled with virtual brisket. He is gaunt and pale. Someone should probably give him an IV, maybe a brisket sandwich.  
  
12:30pm - Sam arrives with an array of medical supplies. He inspects Tony and find that he has already equipped himself with a catheter and colostomy bag. Good Tony! IV is underway.  
  
1:00pm - Realization suddenly comes. Where is the brisket? Tony is threatened with removal of the IV in order to get him out of VR to disclose the location of the Franklin. Tony refuses. He is locked in.  
  
1:30pm - FedEx arrives at the door of LBP to deliver a 10lb, dry ice-filled package. What could it be? Of course it is the brisket. Tony is propped up on a makeshift throne for his prescience.  
  
2:00pm - Realization suddenly comes. Where are the LBP groceries? Tony is again threatened with bodily harm to tell us where the cheetos and deli meat are. Tony again refuses. Tony is 80% integrated with the VR from the week-long stay. No backing out now.  
  
2:30pm - The doorbell again. AI Tony has ordered all LBP groceries online for on-time delivery. What a monster.  
  
3:00pm - Phil finally gets out of the pool, which has risen to a temperature of 300 degrees. He is lobster red, and all is right with the world.  
  
4:00pm - The rest of the Dallas crew arrives. Tai immediately upgrades Tony's VR system to improve performance. Tony is now at 85% integration! And perfect timing, the brisket is finally warmed up and ready to eat! Huzzah! So smellerific! Tony whimpers. Nick inspects Tony's throne and decides he can do better. AI Tony makes additional purchases with next-day delivery.  
  
6:00pm - The brisket is gone. Poor choices were made and everyone is now in a meat coma.  
  
8:00pm - Like the honey badger rising from a snake bite to eat again, people start to rouse themselves. Bill mumbles something about a business idea but no one can understand him with the brisket tucked between his cheek and gum.  
  
9:00pm - Po arrives with 25lbs of ribeye. Everyone groans. Curtis puts it on the grill anyway. Go big or go home!  
  
10:00pm - 1/2 limit poker game begins. AI Tony folds a nut straight after being bluffed by Phil. AI still needs work.  
**  
Friday, August 18th, 2017:**  
  
8:00am - Curtis begins the day by deciding from the many arts and crafts he brought along. Magazines? Painting? Watercolors? Diorama? Too much to choose from. He finally settles on Lincoln Logs for their non-permanent nature, then promptly pulls out super glue and makes a huge wooden Lincoln Dong to hang in his front hallway.  
  
8:30am - The annual LBP Golf Tournament is underway. Phil has agreed to play, but his newly formed lobster claws are a detriment to his golf grip. Oh well!  
  
10:00am - Delayed breakfast on account of Tony being a computer. Keith arrives and, realizing the business potential of AI Tony, immediately retains Willie to divest himself of his discount prescription company and to draw up papers to take conservatorship of AI Tony. He and Garner spend the day behind closed doors talking about data lakes and guacamole.  
  
12:00am - Materials arrive for Tony's new throne. Beechwood, gold inlay and dark blue polo knit cloth? Nick nods approvingly and sets to work. Meanwhile, Curtis grills tasty burgers and begins his evolution from  
  
2:00pm - The participants of the LBP Golf Tournament crawl to shade and collapse in the breezeway. Somehow, without actually attending, Keith made the winning putt of the tournament. Phil's lobster claws ache from pinching golf clubs, and he severed a couple of shafts in the process, but he still shot a respectable 101. Sam is considering a case study on emergent metamorphosis of human limbs in hyper-escalating water temperature.  
  
5:00pm - Dr. Brewer begins an intense self-examination of his alter egos. Why does Curtis create such amazing, yet conflicting art (and tasty burgers), and how is CB so good at sleeping and playing poker at the same time? There's a paper to be written here.  
  
8:00pm - Todd makes dinner, which consists entirely of bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers. AI Tony whines mechanically about how his VR doesn't support poppers. Rusty and Phil discuss how to write a subroutine in COBOL to compensate. Keith, peering into the room from his closet discussions with Garner, taps his fingers together and sinisterly closes the door. 90% integration complete.  
  
10:00pm - Damon pulls out Axis and Allies and sets up the board, hoping someone else will get sucked in. Garner, smelling the sweet perfume of a Russian victory, is lulled out of the closet. Nick is busy stuffing the new throne to maximize Tony's comfort, but agrees to play the UK. AI Tony is dispassionate about comfort and already knows who will win A&A, but whatever.  
  
**Saturday, August 19th, 2017:**  
  
8:00am - Tai pulls out the movie hard drive and whips up a morning serving of Black Beauty.  
  
10:00am - The bathrooms in the PLBJ are pushed to the breaking point, as the jalapeno popper dinner has its obvious and expected effect.  
  
12:00pm - What were we supposed to do in this time slot again? Definitely not boating.  
  
2:00pm - No one wants to go near the pool, as they've all seen what happened to Phil. The water in the pool actually turns molten. Science that, bitches.  
  
4:00pm - A symposium on all of the amazingly fucked up things happening to LBPers is convocated. Drs. Crowley, Lam and Brewer all give presentations on the long-term effects of sporadic, intense infusions of proteins to the human body. It is determined that LBP should happen at precisely one year intervals, not this 13 month bullshit.  
  
6:00pm - Pre-season footyball with the Dallas Cowboys, served with a heaping side of HEB fajitas! AI Tony predicts the score will be Cowboys 21, Colts 10. Bill places large parlay bets with his bookie in Vegas based on AI Tony's information. How did guacamole get made? Garner seemed to just whip it out of thin air!  
  
8:30pm - Nick puts the finishing touches on an impressive comeback win for the Allies, bombing Damon's Germany back into the stone age and ending once and for all Nazi fascist oppression. OR DID HE?  
  
9:00pm - After beating the Colts 21-10, Dak Prescott thanks Almighty God for being in his ear during playcalls tonight. AI Tony snickers. 95% integrated. Nick finishes work on the Tony Throne, and he is properly installed. The throne includes built-in VR controllers and a Squatty Potty.  
  
9:01pm - The LBP Poker Tournament begins! Many people are leery of letting AI Tony play, but he swears he won't be using bioheuristics to cheat. As if any of us really know what that means....  
  
10:00pm - Willie finishes the paperwork delivering custody of AI Tony to Keith. AI Tony digitally signs his consciousness away, becoming the first AI slave. Sam, who has been periodically resuscitating Tony's body to allow for the transfer process to complete, has to muck a back-breaking hand against Phil to put the paddles to him once more, and is out of the tournament.  
  
11:00pm - AI Tony goes out in fourth place after being steamrolled by CB, who played his customary 2-7 offsuit into a successful river boat against Tony's Ace-King. Humans 1, AI 0.  
  
12:30am - After a stirring battle of wits, Rusty wins the LBP Poker Tournament by using a nifty move he learned watching Rounders. CB snores softly in defeat.  
  
**Sunday, August 20th, 2017:**  
  
8:00am - AI Tony becomes fully integrated. He has achieved immortality! The lifeless husk of Tony Ferrante is interred beside the lava pool, with memorial provided by Rev. Salmi. AI Tony is copied to Keith's USB key and they begin to work out visitation rights with Jennifer. Everyone's phones begin to ring at once.
