Gentlemen, I present to you now the agenda for LBP XXII: Hunting Ranch of Mystery  
Thursday, July 14th 2022  
  
8:00am - LBP XXII is upon us! Rejoice and be free! Everyone wakes up at exactly 8am and begins mentally preparing for the trek to Jacksboro, Texas.  
  
9:00am - Pre-LBP Dojo workouts are in full flow, with Todd taking a wistful virtual ride around Mineral Wells, while Tony and Curtis lift heavy for those mad gains.  
  
10:30am - Departure from Austin, with a stop to pick up Dan from the airport along the way. A stop at Storms in Lampasas is required by the natural law. Tony looks positively healthy, as if he never had COVID at all.  
  
12:00pm - Departure from Dallas. Phil has finished all of his work for the next two months in advance to make sure he is not disturbed, and he's going to make up for lost time at LBP these past years. Po is collected from DFW on the way through town, and he tosses a large, heavy case into the trunk.  
  
2:00pm - The Austin caravan somehow checks in at Lost Creek Hunting Ranch before the Dallas gang, and Cheyenne and Brannen are right there at the gate to let them in. They have an almost euphoric cheer about them as they parade the group around the compound, paying special attention to the field dressing and meat storage area. Nothing wrong with loving your job, right?  
  
3:00pm - The Dallas crew, laden with groceries, arrive at the ranch. Phil seems to have commandeered the provisioning process this year, as the groceries are 90% Cheetos and 10% sliced deli meat. The Franklin brisket is brought forth and put in its water bath, drawing oohs and aahs from the ranch managers, and perhaps even a faint muttered prayer. Keith lingers in the room for a moment after everyone leaves, eyeing the brisket nervously.  
  
4:00pm - Bill arrives just in time to enjoy the freshly-cut brisket, deftly avoiding the previous year's brisket rage. Phil ignores the brisket and cracks open a bag of Cheetos.  
  
5:00pm - Into the pool with everyone! Todd jumps in and immediately cries out in pain, and leaps back out as if burned. Cheyenne and Brennen look on with amazement and slightly quizzical faces. Everyone else seems fine in the pool, though the faux grotto is deemed insufficient to support human life in Texas. Plans are drawn to build a full cave structure over the jacuzzi portion of the pool.  
  
6:00pm - Tai has completed setting up the Roku for the weekend, and begins the LBP movie festival with Once Upon a Time in China. Willy and DK have some words over the upcoming Austin FC / FC Dallas game, but it's all just playful banter.  
  
8:00pm - C&B ask if anyone wants to go night hunting feral hogs. No one seems very enthused, not even Bill. C&B seem a bit put off but grudgingly head off to their bunks for the night.  
  
9:00pm - Phil has been downing Cheetos like mad all evening, yet hasn't made much of a dent in the Wall O' Cheeto. There's a faint orange sheen to his skin, but that's probably just the Cheeto sweats.  
  
11:30pm - Late night cash game, and everyone trades pots fairly evenly. The weekend is shaping up to be the best LBP Poker Tournament ever! A noise is heard outside nearby, followed by brisk running off into the night, but it's assumed that it's just some "wild" game.  
  
**Friday, July 15th 2022**  
  
8:00am - Cheyenne and Brennen barge into the compound, rousing everyone with renewed cheerful smiles and hopes of going hunting today! Their hopes are dashed again, as everyone begs off of the wild hunt. Brennan looks disheartened, while Cheyenne has a glint of anger, perhaps even madness, in her eye.  
  
9:00am - A delicious breakfast of ovum and pig is served, with biscuits and gravy on the side, courtesy of the ranch's deep larders. Phil ignores the breakfast and dives headlong into a new bag of Cheetos. His coloring is definitely evolving. Po and Sam take note, but say nothing.  
  
10:00am - LBP Ciudad de las Ideas opens with a keynote session by Keith on the trajectory of the pharmaceutical industry vis a vis COVID, and how he feels that a revolutionary new treatment may be just around the corner if it passes human trials. Everyone is so amazed that no other breakout sessions occur the rest of the weekend.  
  
11:00am - Friday pool party. Nick, Tai and Willy have been lugging rocks from around the ranch to the pool to construct the grotto, and it's about 30% complete. Todd stands at the water's edge, occasionally poking the water with a finger and recoiling in agony. Rounders is playing in the background.  
  
12:00pm - Garner begins pre-preparations for the guacamole. He knew better than to trust Phil with the groceries and packed his own ingredients. Everyone chips in, now that he gave up all of his secrets with the workshop last year. Guacamole is finished in less than an hour with all of the help! A new record! Cheyenne and Brennen recoil at the sight of non-protein food and retreat to their cabin.  
  
3:00pm - Dan, Todd, and Tony break out the guitars. Time for an epic jam session! The old hits abound, but Tony teaches D&T some epic chord structures and they kick out some Nothing But Thieves as well.  
  
4:00pm - Willy decks the compound with FC Dallas gear. DK dons his Verde best and refuses to speak to Willy. Phil has now gone through approximately 30 bags of Cheetos, and is becoming luminescent. Everyone sits down to play Settlers of Catan, surely this will be a peaceful and good natured game.  
  
5:00pm - Cheyenne and Brennen return to implore the group to go hunt something. This is, after all, a hunting ranch! Why reserve this place and put these people to work if not to serve its purpose? Everyone shakes their heads and sends them on their way again, and they are clearly distraught.  
  
6:00pm - Keith digs a small hole in the ground and rolls a golf ball in with his hand. Keith wins the LBP Golf Tournament AGAIN! Dinner is going to be a problem at this LBP, since Phil bought nothing but Cheetos, until Po opens his large suitcase to find a veritable smorgasbord of meats and assorted groceries, dry iced and still chilled. A hasty meal is prepared and consumed, though Phil continues to eat Cheetos unabated.  
  
7:00pm - The LBP Poker Tournament begins. Friday poker tournament is becoming a norm it seems. Oh well, we have footy ball tomorrow night! Everyone implores Phil to wash his Cheeto dust-ridden hands, so as not to sully the cards.  
  
7:05pm - Keith goes all-in with K-J suited, with predictable results.  
  
8:00pm - The tournament is in its third round, with blinds increasing to marginally inconvenient levels. Lots of players still in the game, hanging around looking to move.  
  
9:00pm - Phil, who is being denied Cheetos during the tournament, starts to get the DTs and goes all-in Â on a weak hand. Tai calls him with bullets but gets destroyed on the draw. Poor Phil! He can't even bust himself out of the tournament! His orange glow is beginning to wane.  
  
11:00pm - Blinds somehow increased dramatically with no warning, and now half the field is out of the tournament. Cheyenne and Brennen are found peering through a window with a glazed look in their eyes, holding tipped spears and wearing night vision goggles.  
  
11:59pm - Phil stands on the cusp of victory, with only Bill and Garner in his way to a triumphant return to LBPPT dominance. In a performative gesture, he downs an entire bag of Cheetos in under 30 seconds. His orange-ish aura turns into a glaring bright light, and his body explodes into a million points of Cheeto light.  
  
12:00am - Phil appears back in his house in Dallas, perfectly normal. AHHHHHHH! Another year denied his LBP destiny!  
  
12:01am - Garner and Bill go all-in after being temporarily blinded, Kings vs Queens, and Garner draws trips to win! Bill consoles himself by joining Cheyenne and Brennen on a late night hog hunt.  
  
**Saturday, July 16th 2022**  
  
8:00am - Hunt success! Bill has killed, field dressed and processed a fine feral hog.  
  
9:00am - Breakfast is served! Lots and lots of porcine products are on offer, and Cheyenne and Brennan appear to be back to their cheery selves.  
  
10:00am - Nick and Tai have finished the grotto project, and not a moment too soon. The sun is a deadly laser, and everyone takes refuge under the spacious shade of the cave. Dan breaks out a lute and plays a rain song, and the skies open up for a moment to provide a brief respite from the oppressive summer sun. Todd stands in the rain just to get his wet on.  
  
2:00pm - Sam and Po confront Keith about his proposed pharmaceutical miracle. It wouldn't happen to have anything to do with the blood draws he stole last year, would it? Keith shrieks like a girl and retreats back to his room with Willy, who has gone full native FC Dallas with face paint and El Matador tank top. DK glares at Willy with contempt in his eyes. No Retreat, No Surrender blares in the background.  
  
4:00pm - Impromptu LBP Dojo workouts begin in earnest. Tony and Curtis start a lift-off to see who can pump the most iron. Todd wanders the ranch because he doesn't have a bike. Cheyenne and Brennen load up on firearms and follow Todd, just in case he wants to shoot something.  
  
5:00pm - DK tears down most of the FC Dallas decorations while Willy is in with Keith, and sets up an Austin FC supporter section at the back of the living room. He starts beating the bongos in preparation for a massive Austin FC win.  
  
6:00pm - Willy emerges and attacks DK. Everyone separates them but tensions are running high throughout the house. Battle lines are drawn and a hastily formed DMZ is created between the two camps.  
  
7:00pm - LBP fajitas, feral hog edition! Everyone gets full and fat on fatback, and the house is temporarily settled down.  
  
8:00pm - Footy Ball Time! Austin FC vs. FC Dallas, and the house is in full supporter mode, chanting and bongos and good times all around. FC Dallas goes ahead on a banger in the first five minutes, but things settle down for the rest of the half as the chess match unfolds.  
  
9:15pm - The second half is turning out to be a barn-burner! Austin FC scores the equalizer on a penalty kick at 57', and both sides are losing their minds with solid tries.  
  
10:00pm - The game has come down to penalty kicks, and on the final try Austin FC nails a shot into the top left corner to win the game! An exhausted Willy and DK embrace at midfield in the living room and collapse on the couch.  
  
11:00pm - Todd finally returns to the house after wandering the ranch for 7 hours, only to find everyone comatose from hog and overexcitement. C&B eye the group lustily, but Todd fights them off with the power of friendship and locks all of the doors to the house.  
  
**Sunday, July 17th 2022**  
  
8:00am - LBP is ending too soon! Everyone wakes up and starts cleaning.  
  
9:00am - A small package of PSDs is found in the back of the pantry and is mercilessly consumed. No orange juice to be found, so everyone eats Cheetos instead.  
  
10:00am - Keith announces that the human trials are complete for his new drug. An amalgamation of all of our blood plasmas, due to exposure to ridiculous LBP hijinks, is a 100% vaccine for COVID. Keith had secretly come to LBP with a full-on bout of COVID, but used the drug in the brisket to inoculate the group. Last night, as his symptoms became almost too much to bear, he finally vaccinated himself and felt great within minutes. Drs. Crowley and Lam promise to peer-review the data and submit for FDA approval.  
  
11:00am - Todd wows us with a sermon about the power of connectivity to the land and community, and how RJ will provide if only we let him. The doors are locked, and we speed away from Lost Creek Hunting Ranch with fond memories and 10 bags of Cheetos apiece. Goodbye LBP XXII, the hype train for LBP XXIII begins anew.
