**Thursday, August 8th, 2019**  
  
7:00am - Absolute latest time that Phil can leave Dallas and have any hope of getting to the Casa before anyone else. The trek to Casa Cantera has begun! Wait, who the hell booked this Poltergeist reboot-of-a-house again?  
  
8:00am - Phil sits patiently at the gate to Casa Cantera. Apparently he left in the middle of the night just to be sure he could move south of his house again. Success!  
  
9:00am - Tony awakens, rested and refreshed. All of his LBP packing completed the night before, he spends the early morning contemplating the munificence of life restored. Everyone else wakes up feeling like a bag of used crap, because we're old.  
  
10:00am - LBP shopping commences at the Wimberley HEB. Tony still has moments of outrageous hunger, and thus the grocery list is doubled, just in case.  
  
12:00pm - Shopping completed, the wayward procurement team heads for the Casa and finds Phil loitering around the gate. Tony walks up and pushes the gate open, to the surprise of almost no one. Poor Phil, when will he learn?  
  
12:30pm - Cataloguing of the contents of Casa Cantera commences, for posterity's sake. Freshly drywalled and spackled, the innards of the house look brand new, and the furniture has been completely replaced. And not a whiff of Celis Grand Cru! It's like we were never there at all.  
  
1:00pm - Todd and Curtis arrive. Todd, wary of the power of this place, holds a crucifix in one hand and a bottle of holy water in the other. Curtis edges close to the threshold of the Casa and, upon finding himself basically, well, himself, he wanders back toward the grill area to appraise the situation.  
  
2:00pm - Nick, Tai, Willie, and Keith arrive. Nick nods approvingly at the furniture upgrades, and Tai immediately starts work on connecting his movie library to the new entertainment system.  
  
3:00pm - Something is amiss. We should be full of brisket by now. Oh no! Tony left the chilled brisket babies at home! Emergency protocols are engaged.  
  
4:00pm - Bill arrives with two Franklin briskets in tow. They are immediately submerged for their luscious water bath.  
  
5:00pm - Sam arrives with a small hard-sided briefcase that appears to be refrigerated and has the word EXPERIMENTAL on the side. He has nothing to say on the matter.  
  
6:00pm - Brisket is served, and there is much rejoicing. Both briskets are consumed in a matter of minutes. Sam appears to take notes while he consumes meat.  
  
7:00pm - Chuck, Damon, and Po arrive with enough beer and auxiliary meat to provision the Casa for weeks. They are bummed that there's no more brisket, but Curtis grills up steaks for each of them as compensation. Sam scribbles some additional notes.  
  
9:00pm - 1/2 cash poker begins with Bill betting heavily on rags and calling everything Phil bets. Sam sits quietly listening to Coldplay and watching the proceedings with interest. Tony goes out early and decides that the margs are calling him to bed.  
  
12:00pm - Everyone passes out almost simultaneously, except for Chuck, Damon, and Po, who stay up late playing random songs on the HomePod and drinking heavily.  
  
**Friday, August 9th, 2019**  
  
8:00am - Rusty wakes up, rested and refreshed. Stepping out to the front of the house, he's perplexed by the vehicles in the main drive. Among others, a 1989 Dodge Daytona Shelby, a 1987 Honda Civic, a 1985 Chevy Astro, a Nissan 240SX, a Volkswagon Karmann Ghia and what can to Rusty's mind only be called The Biggun sit where everyone's cars should be. Odd, maybe they double-booked the Casa this weekend? He wanders off to the Casita to see if anyone is squatting their compound.  
  
9:00am - The rest of the group wake up and are astonished at their appearance. With the exception of Tony, Chuck, Damon and Po, everyone looks and feels 25 years younger. Also, they kind of don't know where they are, how they got there, or anything about the last 25 years. But Phil doesn't look like he was ever a lobster (or Red Phil, for that matter) and Chase's ribs don't ache anymore from being put into a window. So that's kind of neat.  
  
10:00am - Everyone jumps in the pool! They can jump again with their young legs! Frolicking commences! Bill, like a grizzly bear looking for salmon, throws everyone around in the pool much to their chagrin.  
  
11:00am - Tony, Chuck, Damon, and Po sit down to consider what has happened, and why they weren't affected. Surely this can't be a coincidence, Casa Cantera must be up to its old hijinks. Right?  
  
12:00pm - After two hours in the pool, the young LBPers decide to pitch tents in the back area of the Casa. Staying in stuffy houses is old people fun, plus there's fire to be made and cans of beans to throw in the fire.  
  
1:00pm - After some major group-think, Tony remembers Sam's behavior from the night before and takes off for his bedroom. After a thorough search, a journal and several stacks of papers are found, along with the briefcase, which now holds several empty vials. Po starts deciphering the journal.  
  
3:00pm - Todd and Curtis decide to chicken fry some Earl's sausages, because that might be a neat idea to try. Everyone agrees that no one has ever thought of anything like that before. Geniuses!  
  
3:30pm - Nick and Tai start talking about the best way to disinfect a rice cooker that has had rice in it for several months. It is generally agreed upon that throwing the device away and purchasing a new one is best.  
  
4:00pm - Chuck and Damon decide that they're going to take this opportunity to culture the young'uns with music knowledge of the 90s and 00s. After some deliberation about what to culture them with, they decide that the 80s is pretty much better than anything that's come along since and just leave them be.  
  
5:00pm - Phil wants to go find some hotties. Tony has to sit everyone down and explain to them that they're all married. This is going to take a while...  
  
6:00pm - Keith finds a random golf club and ball and hits a monster shot from the Casa that lands in the cup of the 18th hole somewhere. Keith wins the LBP golf tournament AGAIN!  
  
7:00pm - Rusty wants to know what this electronics stuff is lying next to the TV. Tony blanches at the sight of the VR equipment, and forcefully tells Rusty that it is NOT Daytona. The next 10 minutes are spent with Rusty and Chase screaming DAYTOOOOOONNNNAAAA! all around the house.  
  
8:00pm - Dinner is served. Meat, with more meat, and some meat on the side. Everyone eats an amazing amount of meat, pressuring even the stockpile added by Po. Where is Po?  
  
9:00pm - After some searching, Po is found in the Casita, which he has converted into a makeshift laboratory. He announces that Sam had been working over the past year with Tony's blood and tissue samples and had devised a kind of de-aging serum from them, but that no one would even allow him to test it on lab rats. Sam was convinced that it would work, and his final notes were about slipping the serum into the briskets and noting the gradual de-aging process over the night, subtle though it was. Memory loss was not part of the plan, though, which is just as well as Po, Damon and Chuck (noted as "Steak Boys" in Sam's journal) were set to be the control group. Po vows to find a way to reverse the effects.  
  
11:00pm - A 1/2 cash game breaks out, but Phil is pretty much the only person that remembers how to play Texas Hold Em, so he wrecks everyone and they all decide to go to bed.  
  
12:00am - Everyone passes out almost simultaneously, except for Tony, Chuck, and Damon, who stay up late playing random songs on the HomePod and drinking heavily. Po continues to work diligently in the Casita de Laboratorio.  
  
**Saturday, August 10th, 2019**  
  
8:00am - Everyone wakes up rested but hung over. Po makes a big breakfast of eggs, bacon, patty sausage, and chorizo for everyone, and an insane amount of food is consumed. A dull ache comes over everyone, and Po seems satisfied. Rusty looks out front, and the cars have been replaced by mid-to-late 1990s vehicles, except for the 240SX.  
  
 
10:00am - Sam, who like everyone else has been having trouble unlocking their phones for the past 24 hours because they can't think of  what future them would use, finally figures out that his password is actually what it was as a 19 year-old. "FuckKiele" is apparently still in vogue. He taps on something that looks like Spotticus and is instantly greeted by an entire playlist of Coldplay and Dave Matthews, which he falls in love with all over again.  
  
11:00am - A somber moment overcomes the group as a realization hits Chase. "Garner's not here! Is he dead? Is he gettin' LAID!?" Damon reassures him that he's just not here this year, but may still be gettin' laid. The Steak Boys and Tony take a moment to reflect on the fact that Garner will not, in fact, finish the guacamole this year. Man down.  
  
12:00pm - Like a well-oiled Swiss monkey in heat, lunch is served. Bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers, Stubbs-infused hamburgers, exceptionally thin-sliced deli turkey sandwiches, and Cheetos galore. By the end of the meal, everyone is feeling sluggish and looking noticeably older. Po nods sagely. "Good, good," he says. Rusty's car hallucinations have shifted to late 2000s, sensible family vehicles, except for an over-the-top Mercedes AMG.  
  
1:00pm - A Pavlovian tug besets the group. A gravitational pull toward water and boating sports. A plan is hatched to leave the Casa. Thinking on his feet, Chuck grabs the kayak from the garage, which for obvious reasons wasn't immediately pulled out, and throws it into the pool. Hilarity ensues, but at a more reasonable pace.  
  
3:00pm - Willie, Tai, and Nick take time from the two day-long battle raging over the Axis and Allies board to play a little FIFA 95 on the Sega Genesis. Their hands ache after the first 30 minutes, but they keep battling for supremacy. Willie almost pulls out a victory against Nick, but we should all really know better by now.  
  
5:00pm - Todd and Curtis get into deep discussions about sound government education policy and the intersection of meat and religion. Todd starts humming a catchy TV theme song wistfully.  
  
6:00pm - LBP fajitas are finished, along with a bevy of fixin's, mostly of the meat variety. The group looks mostly like their old selves again, and Rusty's eyes have completely cleared up and the cars are back to normal. That Visine stuff does wonders.  
  
8:00pm - NFL Preseason football with the Dallas Cowboys against the San Francisco 49ers. The young LBPers are amazed that a) Emmitt Smith apparently retired in the midst of his prime, and b) who is this guy playing quarterback? The shock is enough to jar everyone's repressed memories and thoughts of the Romo years come flooding back, depressing everyone. But at least now they remember their wives who got them through the lean years. Right? Sam takes a moment to apologize for using everyone as guinea pigs, and Po explains that by using the brisket as a delivery mechanism, combined with the latent magical energies of Casa Cantera, the serum's effect was temporary and diminished by meat intake.  
  
9:00pm - The LBP Poker Tournament is set to begin! Everyone's poker minds are sharp as tacks and freshly honed by the memories of every bad beat that Phil has given them over their lifetimes. Surely this won't put them on tilt?  
  
9:01pm - Keith goes out on a K-J all-in.  
  
9:02pm - Chase goes out on with Jacks full of Queens to Phil's two pair of fours. WHAT?  
  
9:30pm - Everyone has gone out except Rusty, Phil, Nick, Tony and Bill. The demolition derby of LBP poker is especially brutal this year. Curtis never has adequate time to ramp up to CB, and Sam basically gave up his chips to pine after Chris Martin's sultry smooth vocals, which is exactly what he would do under normal circumstances.  
  
10:00pm - Phil has bullied everyone off the table except for Bill, who refuses to be bullied by someone he could manhandle at basketball in his youth. The battle is fierce, and is watched by absolutely no one except Keith who likes to shuffle cards and create poker drama. In the end, Phil's scheming ways overcome Bill's brutish table manner in dramatic fashion, with the exact final hands of Rounders. PHIL WINS THE LBP POKER TOURNAMENT! But where is the Chief?  
  
12:00am - Everyone stays up entirely too late playing random songs on the HomePod and drinking heavily.  
  
**Sunday, August 11th, 2019**  
  
8:00am - Everyone wakes up aching like they got the crap beaten out of them by a legion of jack-booted nuns that kick ass for the lord!  
  
9:00am - A hastily thrown-together breakfast of PSDs and orange juice is consumed, and people mill about contemplating the melancholy of life restored.  
  
10:00am - Pastor Todd gives a rousing homily on the beauty of a well-lived life, lifting everyone's spirits considerably. Sam is slapped with a restraining order filed by Willie overnight with the Hays County Justice of the Peace, barring him from doing sciency crap on them ever again.  
  
11:00am - The last car is packed, the doors are locked, and the clock is reset for LBP XXI, which WILL BE LESS THAN A YEAR AWAY THIS TIME OR THERE WILL BE SHOUTING.
