7:00am - Mandatory departure time for all persons not living in the Greater Austin Metropolitan Area.  
  
10:00am - Tony "King of Meats" Ferrante arrives at Franklin Barbecue to obtain the brisket that we are pretty sure he ordered. Maybe.  
  
10:15am - Having sampled the brisket and found it to be of divine quality, Tony is infused with the smell of slow and low meat and must fight through the hordes of people standing in line for hours. He barely makes it away with his life.  
  
11:00am - The Franklin brisket is safely ensconced in an oven at a secret location in Leander, TX. For its own good. Arrangements are made for a cleaning team to come in afterward to purge the house of brisket smell.  
  
11:45am - LBP Grocery Fest 2k15 begins. HEB closes the store for the LBP-only event. A Frito-Lay truck is on standby at the back of the building in case the Cheetos supply is not sufficient. Deli meats are sliced and packaged for our consumption.  
  
12:15pm - Phil arrives on-scene to inspect the progress of the event, but is immediately called away by a pressing code problem at work. No Phil, stop!  
  
1:00pm - The LBP Grocery Team completes its mission, having acquired four grocery carts full of food, and begins the trek to the PLT. Meanwhile, Dr. Brewer and Pastor Todd arrive at the PLT and begin the arduous task of inventorying the pool contents.  
  
2:00pm - Official LBP Sweet XVI check-in time. LBP Sweet XVI custom koozies and name tags are distributed. A one-time DNA sample is procured from each attendee, heralding the beginning of the LBP Clone Wars.  
  
3:00pm - Keynote address: Phil Taylor, fresh off his work conference call, provides an energizing, powerful invocation to LBP, then promptly cannonballs into the pool. IT'S ON!  
  
4:00pm - Damon delivers beers to those in the pool, taking care to not cause another Man Down situation. The First Annual Shrine to the Man Down is placed at the site of His loss and finding.  
  
7:00pm - Tai pulls out the video library and plays Pain and Gain. Everybody groans. Burgers and beans are served.  
  
9:00pm - Rusty starts rolling pre-made characters for the D&D session Saturday that won't actually ever occur.  
  
10:00pm - Garner calls for a game of [Three-Man](http://www.webtender.com/handbook/games/threeman.game). Tony does the right thing and goes to bed.  
  
12:00pm - The 1-2 limit cash game begins, everybody is wasted so it doesn't last long.  
  
**Friday, June 26th, 2015**  
  
7:00am - What the fuck happened?  
  
8:00am - Todd and Tony begin work on the LBP Sweet XVI Breakfast, now with brisket!  
  
9:00am - Dr. Brewer gives a symposium on proper Arts and Crafts techniques and best practices.  
  
10:00am - The LBP Golf Tournament field begins their grueling 18 holes of sweating. Rusty starts working on a new book on collective code ownership.  
  
11:00am - Keith stays behind at the PLT and begins planning a secret boat trip. Joey finds out and the struggle for the LBP Sweet XVICaptaincy begins.  
  
1:00pm - The pool feels oh-so-good to those people not partaking of golf. Fresh turkey sandwiches and Doritos are really hitting the spot.  
  
3:00pm - The LBP Golf tournament wraps up with another stunning 75-foot putt to win out by Keith, who showed up at the end just for that one putt to steal Sam's thunder.  
  
4:00pm - Rusty finishes his book and submits it for LBP review. Dr. Brewer asks to write a foreword espousing CCO as the blueprint to eradicate privilege in the programming world. Sam slinks away from the PLT to go see Dave Matthews in concert. They're playing in New Jersey.  
  
6:00pm - Why hasn't Garner started working on the guacamole yet?  
  
6:30pm - Women's World Cup - USA vs. Germany. We all can't even so hard. A TV is moved outdoors so that we can all enjoy the game from the comfort of the pool.  
  
9:00pm - The frolicking over the US women's team victory can't be contained within the PLT. Willie ends up streaking down the street, living up to his nickname's billing.  
  
11:00pm - Nick and Garner's five year streak of winning spades games comes to an abrupt end as Bill and Chase each go nil on every hand.  
  
**Saturday, June 27th, 2015**  
  
7:00am - What the fuck happened?  
  
8:00am - Rusty and Tony serenade the PLT with a rousing rendition of "John Jacob Jinglehiemer Schmidt". Pastor Todd, who has been down in the mouth this LBP, misses his song-making partner. Matt surprises everyone with the knowledge that he can play guitar and bass, and thus a new partnership is forged. This will be the greatest hit in the history of LBP!  
  
10:00am - Keith announces his intention to rent a boat on the newly refilled Lake Travis. Everyone hops aboard and the Day of Fun commences.  
  
11:00am - Sam returns from his clandestine trip to Jersey. Dave Matthews was awesome as always, but where is everyone? Maybe if he sits down at the shoreline they'll pick him up.  
  
2:00pm - Keith and Joey wrestle like savages over the wheel to the boat. Joey forces Keith into submission and reclaims his birthright. The victory is empty though, as their struggle leads to the boat going aground on what is left of the Sometimes Islands. Fortunately provisions were brought, and hot dogs and deli fresh sandwiches tide the party over until they are rescued by some hotties in a cigarette boat. Phil doesn't even know what to do with himself.  
  
6:30pm - Women's World Cup - Brazil vs. Norway. Arguments over racial preference are fierce but short-lived, as everyone agrees that soccer girls are just ridiculously hot period.  
  
7:00pm - Todd teaches Matt the theme song to Punky Brewster, just in case.  
  
8:00pm - Fajita time! Garner has been preparing the guacamole for days without anyone ever knowing. Everyone cheers!  
  
9:00pm - The LBP Poker Tournament begins.  
  
9:01pm - Keith goes out on a K-J of spades. When will he learn?  
  
10:00pm - Several players have busted out, but the chip stacks look pretty even around the table. Dr. Brewer is putting in work to summon CB, but can't seem to do so. What has happened?  
  
11:00pm - In a last-ditch gambit, Dr. Brewer finds a bottle of Boone's Farm in the back of the fridge and drains it, then punches Chase. GAME. ON.  
  
11:15pm - Po tests Chase for concussion and he gets the all-clear to continue in the tournament. Nick busts out Tai, Rusty busts out Garner, and Phil takes down Bill with an epic four of a kind hand to beat Bill's full house.  
  
12:30am - Chase takes down Phil! There will be a new Poker Champion this year! Phil cannot believe his poor luck!  
  
1:00am - Three players left; Rusty, Nick and Matt "Whippersnapper" Chase. What happens next?  
  
**Sunday, June 28th, 2015**  
  
7:00am - What the fuck happened? No, really, seriously!  
  
8:00am - Final LBP Sweet XVI breakfast. Tony has resorted to licking the pan that the brisket was in.  
  
9:00am - Everyone mills around. It can't be over.  
  
10:00am - Arts and Crafts are packed away neatly and groceries are fought over. All remaining Cheetos go into Phil's car. Po and DK grab a bottle of wine and head for the airport, Brussels is next! Willie, full of sage marriage advice granted him all weekend, heads home to put it all to good use. Keith and Bill shake hands on a deal that will make both of them filthy rich. Tony has done a good job of not going Rocketship all weekend, and celebrates with a Coke Zero. LBP Sweet XVI ends, but the Spirit of LBP lives anew within all of us.  
  
6/17/15: LBP Sweet XVI: The Downstairs Mix-Up (IMPORTANT DETAILS INSIDE)  
  
My brothers,  
  
The PLT is dead! Long live the MLT!  
  
For those of you not on Facebook (shame on you, that's where all the fun stuff happens), there have been some late-breaking changes toLBP this year. First and foremost, Pimpy Lake Travis, the site of last year's LBP, has been denied us. I will let Tony spell out the details in his memoirs (and live out this past weekend in his nightmares), but suffice to say that we have a new home for LBP, and it [looks amazing](http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3952123).
