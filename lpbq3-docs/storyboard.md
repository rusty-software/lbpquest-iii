# Plot

## Hook
"You awaken to dankness, an irregular drip-drip-drip echoing off the walls somewhere beyond the room you find yourself in. The last thing you remember, you were... playing cards?... or was it... eating a jalapeno popper dipped in pate du PSD? Whatever it was, you should definitely not be chilled to the bone. It's summer in Texas after all... or is it?"

- You are actually the Chief
- You will be traveling to at least three different LBP locations to free people to join your party.
	- Party members will include people that have never won the chief

## Opening scene
- You must free yourself from the dungeon you are in
	- You discover you how to free yourself
	- You emerge on the main world
